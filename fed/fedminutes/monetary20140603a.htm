The Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced a new schedule of margins applicable for collateral pledged by depository institutions to secure discount window loans and for payment system risk purposes.
The new margins are part of the Federal Reserve's continuing efforts to ensure effective risk-management policies and procedures in its lending programs to depository institutions. They reflect data and methodological improvements that better account for differences in various risk characteristics across collateral types.
Details on the changes, effective July 1, 2014, are available at www.frbdiscountwindow.org .
