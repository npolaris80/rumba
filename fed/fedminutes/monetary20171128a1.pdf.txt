DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Requests by eleven Reserve Banks to 
maintain the existing primary credit rate and request by one Reserve Bank to 
increase the rate; requests to renew the secondary and seasonal credit formulas. 

Existing rate and formulas approved. 
October 10, 2017. 

Today, Board members discussed economic and financial developments and 

issues related to possible policy actions.  In connection with this discussion, Board 
members considered discounts and advances under the primary credit program (the 
primary credit rate) and discussed, on a preliminary basis, their individual assessments 
of the appropriate rate and its communication, which would be discussed at the next 
joint meeting of the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Dallas, and San 
Francisco had voted on September 28, 2017, and the directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis had voted on 
October 5, to establish the primary credit rate at the existing level (1-3/4 percent).  The 
directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on September 28 to 
establish a rate of 2 percent (an increase from 1-3/4 percent). 

No sentiment was expressed by the Board at today's meeting for changing the 

primary credit rate at this time, and the Board approved the establishment of the primary 
credit rate at the existing level of 1-3/4 percent.  (NOTE:  At the joint Board-FOMC 
meeting on September 20, 2017, the Board had approved the establishment of the 
primary credit rate at the existing level of 1-3/4 percent.) 

The Board's action today on the primary credit rate also included renewal of the 
existing formulas for calculating the rates applicable to discounts and advances under 
the secondary and seasonal credit programs for all twelve Reserve Banks.  The 
directors of each Reserve Bank had requested renewal of these formulas on the dates 
previously noted for their votes on the primary credit rate.  As specified by the formula 
for the secondary credit rate, this rate would be set 50 basis points above the primary 
credit rate.  As specified by the formula for the seasonal credit rate, this rate would be 
reset every two weeks as the average of the daily effective federal funds rate and the 
rate on three-month CDs over the previous 14 days, rounded to the nearest 5 basis 
points.

DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Requests by nine Reserve Banks to maintain 
the existing primary credit rate and requests by three Reserve Banks to increase 
the rate; requests to renew the secondary and seasonal credit formulas. 

Existing rate and formulas approved. 
October 23, 2017. 

Today, Board members discussed economic and financial developments and 

issues related to possible policy actions.  In connection with this discussion, Board 
members considered discounts and advances under the primary credit program (the 
primary credit rate) and discussed, on a preliminary basis, their individual assessments 
of the appropriate rate and its communication, which would be discussed at the joint 
meeting of the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) next week. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco 
had voted on October 12, 2017, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New 
York, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis had voted on October 19, to establish the 
primary credit rate at the existing level (1-3/4 percent).  The directors of the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Cleveland and Kansas City had voted on October 12, and the 
directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond had voted on October 19, to 
establish a rate of 2 percent (an increase from 1-3/4 percent). 

Overall, Federal Reserve Bank directors noted that economic activity continued 
to expand at a solid pace.  Several directors reported continued strength in residential 
real estate activity and growth in spending on commercial construction projects.  Many 
directors had also observed continued expansion in the manufacturing sector and noted 
planned production increases.  While disruptions continued for residents of areas 
affected by recent hurricanes, directors generally did not expect these disruptions to 
have a lasting impact on economic growth at the national level.  Most directors reported 
continued labor-market tightening, and several directors noted that hiring remained 
difficult for certain higher-skill occupations.  Some directors reported wage increases in 
certain sectors, but wage pressures varied across sectors and Districts.  While readings 

Page  2 

of core inflation had softened recently, these declines were viewed as transitory by 
some directors. 

The directors of nine Reserve Banks favored establishing the primary credit rate 
at the current level of 1-3/4 percent.  Against the backdrop of soft readings on inflation 
this year, these directors judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the current 
level of interest rates for now and assess whether incoming data support the outlook for 
continued moderate economic growth, further strengthening in labor markets, and a 
gradual return of inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.  The directors of three 
Reserve Banks favored increasing the primary credit rate to 2 percent.  These directors 
judged that an increase in rates is warranted in light of solid economic growth, already 
tight labor markets, and an expected rise in inflation toward 2 percent. 

No sentiment was expressed by the Board at today's meeting for changing the 

primary credit rate at this time, and the Board approved the establishment of the primary 
credit rate at the existing level of 1-3/4 percent.  (NOTE:  At its meeting on October 10, 
2017, the Board had taken no action on a request by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Kansas City to increase the primary credit rate.) 

The Board's action today on the primary credit rate also included renewal of the 
existing formulas for calculating the rates applicable to discounts and advances under 
the secondary and seasonal credit programs for all twelve Reserve Banks.  The 
directors of each Reserve Bank had requested renewal of these formulas on the dates 
previously noted for their votes on the primary credit rate.  As specified by the formula 
for the secondary credit rate, this rate would be set 50 basis points above the primary 
credit rate.  As specified by the formula for the seasonal credit rate, this rate would be 
reset every two weeks as the average of the daily effective federal funds rate and the 
rate on three-month CDs over the previous 14 days, rounded to the nearest 5 basis 
points.

Approved. 
November 1, 2017. 

In a joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 

and the Board today, the FOMC decided to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent.  Consistent with the FOMC's decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board approved maintaining the 
existing interest rates (1-1/4 percent) paid on required and excess reserve balances.  At 
today's meeting, the Board also approved the establishment of the interest rate on 
discounts and advances made under the primary credit program (the primary credit 
rate) at the existing level (1-3/4 percent). 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco 
had voted on October 26, 2017, to establish the primary credit rate at the existing level 
(1-3/4 percent).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond had voted on 
October 19, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and Kansas 
City had voted on October 26, to establish a rate of 2 percent (an increase from 
1-3/4 percent).  (NOTE:  At its meeting on October 23, the Board had taken no action on 
requests by the Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City Reserve Banks to increase the 
primary credit rate.) 

The Board's action today on the primary credit rate also included renewal of the 
existing formulas for calculating the rates applicable to discounts and advances under 
the secondary and seasonal credit programs.  As specified by the formula for the 
secondary credit rate, this rate would be set 50 basis points above the primary credit 
rate.  As specified by the formula for the seasonal credit rate, this rate would be reset 
every two weeks as the average of the daily effective federal funds rate and the rate on 
three-month CDs over the previous 14 days, rounded to the nearest 5 basis points.
