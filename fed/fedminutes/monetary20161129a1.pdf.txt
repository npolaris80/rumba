October 31, 2016. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Chicago, and Minneapolis had voted on 
October 20, 2016, to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances 
(1 percent) under the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the 
Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, and St. Louis had voted on 
October 20, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Atlanta, 
Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on October 27, to establish a rate of 
1-1/4 percent (an increase from 1 percent).  At its meeting on October 11, the Board had 
taken no action on similar requests by the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, 
Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Reserve Banks to increase 
the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors generally viewed the prospects for growth in 

economic activity as somewhat improved, although their reports varied across different 
sectors and geographic regions.  Overall, directors continued to observe positive 
developments in labor markets, including increased labor force participation and a 
steady pace of hiring in some Districts.  While several directors commented on 
tightening labor market conditions, especially for certain skilled positions, wage 
pressures were largely viewed as moderate.  Some directors cited improvements in 

Page  2 

consumer spending, as well as increased activity in commercial and residential 
construction.  Other directors also noted mixed performance in manufacturing and 
ongoing weakness in the agriculture and energy sectors.  Inflation had increased since 
earlier this year, but it remains below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective. 

Against this backdrop, some Federal Reserve Bank directors recommended that 

the primary credit rate be maintained at its current level of 1 percent.  In general, they 
judged that the economic outlook and below-target inflation supported maintaining the 
current accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Most Federal Reserve Bank 
directors recommended increasing the primary credit rate to 1-1/4 percent, in light of 
actual and expected strengthening in economic activity and labor markets and signs 
that these conditions are fostering a gradual return of inflation to 2 percent over the 
medium term. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chair Yellen, Vice Chairman Fischer,

 and Governors Powell and Brainard.
