Federal Reserve Bank directors remained cautiously optimistic that the economy 
would continue to expand at a moderate pace, although most noted that severe winter 
weather had constrained recent economic activity.  Some directors reported advances 
in capital investment, particularly in the energy sector, as well as a recent pickup in 
demand for business loans, especially for smaller businesses.  Directors had mixed 
reports on construction activity, and consumer spending was described as improving 
only modestly.  Other directors observed a softening in residential mortgage originations 
for both purchases and refinancing.  Overall, businesses were still cautious about hiring, 
and unemployment remained elevated.  However, some directors reported difficulty in 
finding qualified workers for certain positions.  Some directors also voiced concerns 
about the possible negative effects of increased health care costs.  Although recent 
inflation readings were lower than the Federal Open Market Committee's longer-run 
goal, directors did not note a change in longer-term inflation expectations, which had 
remained stable.  Against this backdrop, most directors recommended that the current 
primary credit rate be maintained. 

As another step toward restoring a pre-crisis discount rate structure, some 

directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis points (to 1 percent) 
at this time.  Such an action would result in a 75-basis-point spread between the 
primary credit rate and the upper end of the Federal Open Market Committee's target 
range for the federal funds rate.  These directors favored a move toward normalization 
of the primary credit rate in light of current and anticipated economic conditions. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chair Yellen and Governors Tarullo, Stein,

 and Powell.
