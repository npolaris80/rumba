The Federal Reserve plans to continue periodic testing of Term Deposit Facility (TDF) operations in August.  These operations are aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of the TDF and providing eligible institutions with an opportunity to maintain familiarity with term deposit procedures. The TDF test operations are a matter of prudent planning and have no implications for the near-term conduct of monetary policy.
Two operations will be conducted--one on August 6 for 14-day term deposits and one on August 13 for 7-day term deposits. These operations will each offer floating-rate term deposits with the maximum individual award amount set at $5 billion, and the rate set equal to the sum of the interest rate on excess reserves (currently 25 basis points) plus a fixed spread of 1 basis point. Term deposits offered in these two operations will include an early withdrawal feature and settle on the same day each operation is executed. Complete details will be announced on the day prior to each operation on the Board's website. The Federal Reserve plans to conduct similar routine TDF test operations in the coming months. The schedule and terms for future operations will be announced at later dates.
