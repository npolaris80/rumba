Board approves two interim final rules in connection with its initiative to provide liquidity to markets

For release at 6:00 p.m. EDT

    Share 

The Federal Reserve Board on Friday approved two interim final rules in connection with its initiative to provide liquidity to markets by extending loans to banking organizations to finance their purchases of high-quality asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) from money market mutual funds.

The first interim final rule would provide a temporary limited exception from the Board's leverage and risk-based capital rules for bank holding companies and state member banks. The second would provide a temporary limited exception from sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which establish certain restrictions on and requirements for transactions between a bank and its affiliates.

The interim final rules approved by the Board will facilitate participation by depository institutions and bank holding companies in this special lending program as intermediaries between the Federal Reserve and money market mutual funds. These exceptions expire on January 30, 2009, unless extended by the Board, and are subject to various conditions to promote safety and soundness.

Risk-Based Capital Guidelines; Leverage Capital Guidelines

AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

ACTION: Interim final rule with request for public comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: To reduce liquidity and other strains being experienced by 
money market mutual funds, the Federal Reserve System adopted on 
September 19, 2008, a special lending facility (ABCP Lending Facility) 
that enables depository institutions and bank holding companies to 
borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on a nonrecourse basis 
if they use the proceeds of the loan to purchase certain types of 
asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) from money market mutual funds. To 
facilitate this Federal Reserve lending program, the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System (Board) also has adopted, on an interim 
final basis, an exemption from its leverage and risk-based capital 
rules for ABCP held by a state member bank or bank holding company as a 
result of its participation in this program.

DATES: The interim final rule became effective on September 19, 2008. 
Comments must be received on or before October 31, 2008.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In light of the ongoing dislocations in the 
financial markets, and the impact of such dislocations on the 
functioning of the markets for ABCP and on the operations of money 
market mutual funds, the Board adopted the ABCP Lending Facility on 
September 19, 2008. Under the ABCP Lending Facility, depository 
institutions and bank holding companies (banking organizations) are 
able to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on a nonrecourse 
basis on condition that the organizations use the proceeds of the 
Federal Reserve credit to purchase, at amortized cost, certain highly 
rated U.S. dollar-denominated ABCP from money market mutual funds. The 
ABCP purchased must be used to secure the borrowing from the Reserve 
Bank. The purpose of the ABCP Lending Facility is to assist money 
market mutual funds to obtain liquidity by enabling them to sell some 
of their high-credit-quality secured assets at amortized cost. The ABCP 
Lending Facility will expire on January

[[Page 55707]]

30, 2009 (unless further extended by the Board).
    Banking organizations that participate in the ABCP Lending Facility 
must acquire and hold ABCP on their balance sheet. These ABCP holdings 
attract leverage and risk-based capital charges under the Board's 
regulatory capital rules for state member banks and bank holding 
companies. To facilitate the ABCP Lending Facility, and for the reasons 
discussed below, the Board has adopted, on an interim final basis, an 
exemption from its leverage and risk-based capital rules for ABCP 
purchased by a state member bank or bank holding company as a result of 
its participation in the facility. Specifically, the interim final rule 
(i) amends the Board's risk-based capital rules for state member banks 
and bank holding companies to assign a zero percent risk weight to ABCP 
purchased by the banking organization as a result of its participation 
in the facility; and (ii) amends the Board's leverage capital rules for 
state member banks and bank holding companies to permit banking 
organizations to exclude from average total consolidated assets--the 
denominator of the leverage ratio--ABCP purchased by the banking 
organization as a result of its participation in the facility.
    The Board has determined that the current leverage and risk-based 
capital requirements for ABCP acquired by a banking organization 
pursuant to the ABCP Lending Facility do not reflect the substantial 
protections provided to the organization by the Federal Reserve in 
connection with the facility. Because of the non-recourse nature of the 
Federal Reserve's credit extension to the banking organization, the 
organization is not exposed to the credit or market risk of the ABCP 
purchased by the organization and pledged to the Federal Reserve. 
Therefore, the Board believes that it would be appropriate--and 
consistent with the economic substance of the transactions--not to 
impose regulatory capital requirements on the ABCP purchased by a 
banking organization in connection with its service as an intermediary 
in the ABCP Lending Facility.
    Consistent with its purpose to mitigate temporary stresses faced by 
U.S. money market mutual funds, the interim final rule will expire on 
January 30, 2009, unless extended by the Board.

Administrative Procedure Act

    Pursuant to sections 553(b) and (d) of the Administrative Procedure 
Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d)), the Board finds that there is good cause 
for making the rule effective immediately on September 19, 2008, and 
that it is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public 
interest to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking and provide an 
opportunity to comment before the effective date. The Board has adopted 
the rule in light of, and to help address, the continuing unusual and 
exigent circumstances in the financial markets. The rule will provide 
immediate regulatory capital relief to state member banks and bank 
holding companies that elect to participate in the Federal Reserve's 
ABCP lending program. The Board is soliciting comment on all aspects of 
the rule and will make such changes that they consider to be 
appropriate or necessary after review of any comments received.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires an agency that is issuing a 
final rule to prepare and make available a regulatory flexibility 
analysis that describes the impact of the final rule on small entities. 
5 U.S.C. 603(a). The Regulatory Flexibility Act provides that an agency 
is not required to prepare and publish a regulatory flexibility 
analysis if the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
5 U.S.C. 605(b).
    Pursuant to section 605(b), the Board certifies that this interim 
final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. The rule reduces regulatory burden on large 
and small state member banks and bank holding companies by granting an 
exemption from the leverage and risk-based capital rules for state 
member banks and bank holding companies that purchase ABCP from money 
market mutual funds pursuant to the Federal Reserve's ABCP lending 
program.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3506; 5 
CFR Part 1320 Appendix A.1), the Board has reviewed the interim final 
rule under authority delegated to the Board by the Office of Management 
and Budget. The rule contains no collections of information pursuant to 
the Paperwork Reduction Act.

Plain Language

    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the Board to use 
``plain language'' in all proposed and final rules. In light of this 
requirement, the Board has sought to present the interim final rule in 
a simple and straightforward manner. The Board invites comment on 
whether it could take additional steps to make the rule easier to 
understand.

[Regulation W; Docket No. R-1330]


Transactions Between Member Banks and Their Affiliates: Exemption 
for Certain Securities Financing Transactions Between a Member Bank and 
an Affiliate

AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board).

ACTION: Interim final rule with request for public comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: In light of the continuing unusual and exigent circumstances 
in the financial markets, the Board has adopted, on an interim final 
basis, a regulatory exemption for member banks from certain provisions 
of section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Board's Regulation W. 
The exemption increases the capacity of member banks, subject to 
certain conditions designed to help ensure the safety and soundness of 
the banks, to enter into securities financing transactions with 
affiliates.

DATES: The interim final rule became effective on September 14, 2008. 
Comments must be received on or before October 31, 2008.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In light of the ongoing dislocations in the 
financial markets, and the potential impact of such dislocations on the 
functioning of the U.S. tri-party repurchase agreement market, the 
Board has adopted on an interim basis the following exemption from 
section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c) and the Board's 
Regulation W (12 CFR part 223). The exemption will facilitate the 
ability of an affiliate of a member bank (such as an SEC-registered 
broker-dealer) to obtain financing, if needed, for securities or other 
assets that the affiliate ordinarily would have financed through the 
U.S. tri-party repurchase agreement market. The exemption is subject to 
several conditions designed to protect the safety and soundness of the 
member bank.
    First, the member bank may use the exemption to finance only those 
asset types that the affiliate currently finances in the U.S. tri-party 
repurchase agreement market.
    Second, the transactions must be marked to market daily and subject 
to daily margin maintenance requirements,

[[Page 54308]]

and the member bank must be at least as over-collateralized in its 
securities financing transactions with the affiliate as the affiliate's 
clearing bank was in its U.S. tri-party repurchase agreement 
transactions with the affiliate on September 12, 2008. The Board 
expects the member bank and its affiliate to use standard industry 
documentation for the exempt securities financing transactions (which 
would, among other things, qualify the transactions as securities 
contracts or repurchase agreements for purposes of U.S. bankruptcy 
law).
    Third, to ensure that member banks use the exemption in a manner 
consistent with its purpose--that is, to help provide liquidity to the 
U.S. tri-party repurchase agreement market--the aggregate risk profile 
of the exempt securities financing transactions must be no greater than 
the aggregate risk profile of the affiliate's U.S. tri-party repurchase 
agreement transactions on September 12, 2008. The exemption, therefore, 
permits an affiliate to obtain financing from its affiliated member 
bank for securities positions that the affiliate did not own or finance 
in the U.S. tri-party repurchase agreement market on September 12, 
2008, but only if the new positions in the aggregate do not increase 
the overall risk profile of the affiliate's portfolio.
    Fourth, the member bank's top-tier holding company must guarantee 
the obligations of the affiliate under the securities financing 
transactions (or must provide other security to the bank that is 
acceptable to the Board). Any member bank that intends to use a form of 
credit enhancement other than a parent company guarantee must consult 
in advance with Board staff. An example of the type of other security 
arrangement that may be acceptable to the Board would be a pledge by 
the affiliate or parent holding company to the member bank of a 
sufficient amount of additional liquid, high-quality collateral.
    Fifth, a member bank may use the exemption only if the bank has not 
been specifically informed by the Board, after consultation with the 
bank's appropriate Federal banking agency, that the bank may not use 
this exemption. If the Board believes, after such consultation, that 
the exempt securities financing transactions pose an unacceptable level 
of risk to the bank, the Board may withdraw the exemption for the bank 
or may impose supplemental conditions on the bank's use of the 
exemption.
    Consistent with its purpose to ameliorate potential temporary 
dislocations in the U.S. tri-party repurchase agreement market, the 
exemption will expire on January 30, 2009, unless extended by the 
Board.
    The Board notes that any securities financing transactions between 
the member bank and an affiliate are subject to the market terms 
requirement of section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c-
1). Section 23B requires that financial transactions between a bank and 
its affiliate be on terms and under circumstances (including credit 
standards) that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to 
the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions 
with or involving nonaffiliates. Among other things, section 23B would 
require the member bank to apply collateral haircuts to its affiliated 
securities financing transaction counterparty that are at least as 
strict as the bank would apply to comparable unaffiliated securities 
financing transaction counterparties.

Administrative Procedure Act

    Pursuant to sections 553(b) and (d) of the Administrative Procedure 
Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d)), the Board finds that there is good cause 
for making the exemption effective immediately on September 14, 2008, 
and that it is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public 
interest to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking and provide an 
opportunity to comment before the effective date. The Board has adopted 
the exemption in light of, and to help address, the continuing unusual 
and exigent circumstances in the financial markets. The exemption will 
provide immediate relief to participants in the U.S. tri-party 
repurchase agreement market affected by the current turmoil. The Board 
is soliciting comment on all aspects of the exemption and will make 
such changes that it considers to be appropriate or necessary after 
review of any comments received.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires an agency that is issuing a 
final rule to prepare and make available a regulatory flexibility 
analysis that describes the impact of the final rule on small entities. 
5 U.S.C. 603(a). The Regulatory Flexibility Act provides that an agency 
is not required to prepare and publish a regulatory flexibility 
analysis if the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
5 U.S.C. 605(b).
    Pursuant to section 605(b), the Board certifies that this interim 
final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. The rule reduces regulatory burden on large 
and small insured depository institutions by granting an exemption from 
the Federal transactions with affiliates regime for insured depository 
institutions that engage in securities financing transactions with 
affiliates.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3506; 5 
CFR 1320 Appendix A.1), the Board has reviewed the interim final rule 
under authority delegated to the Board by the Office of Management and 
Budget. The rule contains no collections of information pursuant to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act.

Plain Language

    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the Board to use 
``plain language'' in all proposed and final rules. In light of this 
requirement, the Board has sought to present the interim final rule in 
a simple and straightforward manner. The Board invites comment on 
whether the Board could take additional steps to make the rule easier 
to understand.
