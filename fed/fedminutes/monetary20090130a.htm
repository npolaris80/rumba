Board announces final rules pertaining to the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF)

For immediate release

    Share 

The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced two final rules pertaining to the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF), which extends loans to banking organizations to finance their purchases of high-quality asset-backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds.

The first rule provides a temporary limited exception from the Board's leverage and risk-based capital rules for bank holding companies and state member banks. The second rule provides a temporary limited exception from sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which establish certain restrictions on and requirements for transactions between a bank and its affiliates.

The two final rules, originally approved as interim final rules on September 19, 2008, will facilitate participation by depository institutions and bank holding companies as intermediaries between the AMLF and money market mutual funds. These exceptions are subject to various conditions to promote safety and soundness.

The Board has also adopted a third final rule, originally approved as an interim final rule on September 14, 2008. It provides a temporary exception to the limitations in section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, allowing all insured depository institutions to provide liquidity to their affiliates for assets typically funded in the tri-party repo market.  This exception expires on October 30, 2009, unless extended by the Board, and is subject to various conditions to promote safety and soundness.

The three final rules are attached.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

12 CFR Parts 208 and 225

[Regulations H and Y; Docket No. 1332]


Risk-Based Capital Guidelines; Leverage Capital Guidelines

AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: To reduce liquidity and other strains being experienced by 
money market mutual funds, the Federal Reserve System adopted on 
September 19, 2008, the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market 
Mutual Fund Lending Facility (AMLF) that enables depository 
institutions and bank holding companies to borrow from the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Boston on a nonrecourse basis if they use the proceeds 
of the loan to purchase certain types of asset-backed commercial paper 
(ABCP) from money market mutual funds. To facilitate this Federal 
Reserve lending program, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System (Board) also adopted an exemption from its leverage and risk-
based capital rules for ABCP held by a state member bank or bank 
holding company as a result of its participation in this program.

DATES: Effective January 30, 2009.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
    In light of the ongoing dislocations in the financial markets, and 
the impact of such dislocations on the functioning of the markets for 
ABCP and on the operations of money market mutual funds, the Board 
adopted the AMLF on September 19, 2008. Under the AMLF, depository 
institutions and bank holding companies (banking organizations) are 
able to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on a nonrecourse 
basis on condition that the organizations use the proceeds of the 
Federal Reserve credit to purchase, at amortized cost, certain highly 
rated U.S. dollar-denominated ABCP from money market mutual funds. The 
ABCP purchased must be used to secure the borrowing from the Reserve 
Bank. The purpose of the AMLF is to assist money market mutual funds to 
obtain liquidity by enabling them to sell some of their high-credit-
quality secured assets at amortized cost. The AMLF, which was initially 
scheduled to expire on January 31, 2009, has been extended to April 30, 
2009.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2008), 
``Federal Reserve announces the extension of three liquidity 
facilities through April 30, 2009,'' press release, December 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Banking organizations that participate in the AMLF must acquire and 
hold ABCP on their balance sheet. These ABCP holdings attract leverage 
and risk-based capital charges under the Board's regulatory capital 
rules for state member banks and bank holding companies. To facilitate 
the AMLF, and for the reasons discussed below, on September 19, 2008, 
the Board adopted, on an interim final basis, and requested public 
comment on, an exemption from its leverage and risk-based capital rules 
for ABCP purchased by a state member bank or bank holding company as a 
result of its participation in the facility.\2\ Specifically, the 
interim final rule (i) amended the Board's risk-based capital rules for 
state member banks and bank holding companies to assign a zero percent 
risk weight to ABCP purchased by the banking organization as a result 
of its participation in the facility; and (ii) amended the Board's 
leverage capital rules for state member banks and bank holding 
companies to permit banking organizations to exclude from average total 
consolidated assets--the denominator of the leverage ratio--ABCP 
purchased by the banking organization as a result of its participation 
in the facility.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ 73 FR 55706 (2008).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    After considering the comments, the Board has adopted a final rule 
that is largely identical to the interim final rule but includes minor 
changes to reflect the extended duration of the AMLF. The interim final 
rule provided that the exemptions applied only to ABCP purchased 
between September 19, 2008, and January 30, 2009 from an affiliated 
SEC-registered open-end investment company that holds itself out as a 
money market mutual fund under SEC Rule 2a-7 (17 CFR 270.2a-7). This 
timeframe coincided with the dates of the AMLF. In the final rule, the 
date range for eligible ABCP purchases has been eliminated, but the 
rule continues to provide that the exemptions are available only for 
ABCP that are purchased in order to secure borrowing from the AMLF. As 
a result, the exemptions effectively will no longer be available once 
the AMLF expires.
    The Board has determined that the current leverage and risk-based 
capital requirements for ABCP acquired by a banking organization 
pursuant to the AMLF do not reflect the substantial protections 
provided to the organization by the Federal Reserve in connection with 
the facility. Because of the non-recourse nature of the Federal 
Reserve's credit extension to the banking organization, the 
organization is not exposed to the credit or market risk of the ABCP 
purchased by the organization and pledged to the Federal Reserve. 
Therefore, the Board believes that it is appropriate--and consistent 
with the economic substance of the transactions--not to impose 
regulatory capital requirements on the ABCP purchased by a banking 
organization in connection with its service as an intermediary in the 
AMLF.

Administrative Procedure Act

    Pursuant to sections 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 
U.S.C. Sec.  553(d)), the Board finds that there is good cause for 
making the rule effective immediately on January 30, 2009. The Board 
has adopted the rule in light of, and to help address, the continuing 
unusual and exigent circumstances in the financial markets. The rule 
will provide immediate relief to depository institutions that elect to 
participate in the AMLF.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires an agency that is issuing a 
final rule to prepare and make available a regulatory flexibility 
analysis that describes the impact of the final rule on small entities. 
5 U.S.C. 603(a). The Regulatory Flexibility Act provides that an agency 
is not required to prepare and publish a regulatory flexibility 
analysis if the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
5 U.S.C. 605(b).
    Pursuant to section 605(b), the Board certifies that this final 
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. The rule reduces regulatory burden on large 
and small state member banks and bank holding companies by granting an 
exemption from the leverage and risk-based capital rules for state 
member banks and bank holding companies that purchase ABCP from money 
market mutual funds pursuant to the Federal Reserve's ABCP lending 
program.

Paperwork Reduction Act

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3506; 5 
CFR 1320 Appendix A.1), the Board has reviewed the final rule under 
authority delegated to the Board by the Office of Management and 
Budget. The rule contains no collections of information pursuant to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act.

Plain Language

    Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the Board to use 
``plain language'' in all proposed and final rules. In light of this 
requirement, the Board has sought to present the final rule in a simple 
and straightforward manner. The Board invited comment on whether it 
could take additional steps to make the rule easier to understand. The 
Board received no comments on this subject.
