Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the
percent change in real GDP from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The
conﬁdence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared
errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data
is available in Table 2. Because current conditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed on average over the previous
20 years, the width and shape of the conﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may
not reﬂect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current
assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their
projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the conﬁdence interval
shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections.
Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as “broadly balanced” would view the conﬁdence interval
around their projections as approximately symmetric. For deﬁnitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections,

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Com-
mittee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the
target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The
conﬁdence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and
government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with the SEP
projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because the SEP projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes
for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.
The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric, except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest target
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation is not intended
to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if
doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward
guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may diﬀer
from those that prevailed on average over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the conﬁdence interval estimated
on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty
and risks around their projections.
* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter
of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in Table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than
a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if it has been truncated at zero.

Forecast Uncertainty 

The economic projections provided by the members 
of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Fed-
eral Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy 
among policymakers and can aid public understanding of 
the basis for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty at-
tends these projections, however.  The economic and sta-
tistical  models  and  relationships  used  to  help  produce 
economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions 
of the real world, and the future path of the economy can 
be  affected  by  myriad  unforeseen  developments  and 
events.  Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, 
participants  consider  not  only  what  appears  to  be  the 
most likely economic outcome as embodied in their pro-
jections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the 
likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to 
the economy should they occur. 

Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy 
of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past 
Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal 
Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Fed-
eral  Open  Market  Committee.    The  projection  error 
ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable un-
certainty associated with economic forecasts.  For exam-
ple, suppose a participant projects that real gross domes-
tic  product  (GDP)  and  total  consumer  prices  will  rise 
steadily  at  annual  rates  of,  respectively,  3  percent  and 
2 percent.  If the uncertainty attending those projections 
is  similar  to  that  experienced  in  the  past  and  the  risks 
around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers 
reported  in  table  2  would  imply  a  probability  of  about 
70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range 
of 2.1 to 3.9 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent 
in the second year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the third and 
fourth years.  The corresponding 70 percent confidence 
intervals for overall inflation would be 1.8 to 2.2 percent 
in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 in the second year, 0.9 to 
3.1 percent in the third year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the 
fourth year.  Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these con-
fidence  bounds  in  “fan  charts”  that  are  symmetric  and 
centered  on  the  median  SEP  projections  for  GDP 
growth, the unemployment rate, and the PCE inflation 
rate.  However, in some instances, the risks around the 
projections may not be symmetric.  In particular, the un-
employment  rate  cannot  be  negative;  furthermore,  the 
risks around a particular projection might be tilted to ei-
ther the upside or the downside, in which case the corre-
sponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned 
around the median projection. 

Because  current  conditions  may  differ  from  those 
that prevailed, on average, over history, participants pro-
vide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to 
their  projections  of  each  economic  variable  is  greater 
than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of 
forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented 
in Table 2 and reflected in the width of the confidence 
intervals shown in top panel  of  Figures 4.A through  4.C. 

Participants’  current  assessments  of  the  uncertainty  sur-
rounding their projections are summarized in the bottom 
left panel of those figures.  Participants also provide judg-
ments  as  to  whether  the  risks  to  their  projections  are 
weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or 
are broadly balanced.  That is, while the symmetric histor-
ical  fan  charts  shown  in  the  top  panel  of  Figures  4.A 
through 4.C imply that the risks to participants’ projections 
are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater 
risk that a given  variable will  be above  than below their 
projections.  These judgments are summarized in the lower 
right panels of Figures 4.A through 4.C. 

As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to consider-
able uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because 
each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of 
monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of 
real activity and inflation over time.  If economic condi-
tions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments 
of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would 
change from that point forward.  The final line in Table 2 
shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest 
rates.  They suggest that the historical confidence intervals 
associated with projections  of  the federal funds rate are 
quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confi-
dence  intervals  are  not  strictly  consistent  with  the  SEP 
projections for the federal funds rate, since the SEP pro-
jections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-
comes, but rather are projections of participants’ individ-
ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on 
an end-of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should 
provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path 
of  the  federal  funds  rate  generated  by  the  uncertainty 
about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional 
adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate 
to offset the effects of shocks to the economy. 

The fan chart for the federal funds rate in Figure 5 
has  been  truncated  at  a  federal  funds  rate  of  zero  per-
cent—the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal 
funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee.  This 
approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan 
chart is merely a convention; it does not have any implica-
tions for possible future policy decisions regarding the use 
of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary 
policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.  In 
such situations, the Committee could also employ other 
tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to 
provide additional accommodation. 

While Figures 4.A through 4.C provide information 
on the uncertainty around the SEP economic projections, 
Figure 1 provides information on the range of views across 
FOMC  participants.    A  comparison  of  Figure  1  to  Fig-
ures 4.A through 4.C shows that the disparity of the pro-
jections across participants is much smaller than the aver-
age forecast errors over the past 20 years.

1.  Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 
2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure 
that has been most widely used in government and private economic 
forecasts.  Projection is percent change, fourth quarter of the previous 
year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. 

3.  For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds 
rate.  For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury 
bills.  Historical projections are the average level in the fourth quarter 
of the year indicated, in percent.
