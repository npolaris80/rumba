The Federal Open Market Committee on Friday announced it would expand its March, August, September, and December meetings in 2009 to two days to allow additional time for discussion.  Thus, all eight scheduled meetings in 2009 now are planned for two days.
The four meetings previously planned as one-day meetings will begin on the previously announced Tuesday dates.  The meetings will continue the following day and the Committee's statement will be released around 2:15 p.m. ET on Wednesdays--a day later than originally planned.  Thus, the minutes for each regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee, which ordinarily are made available three weeks after the day of the policy decision, will be made available a day later than previously scheduled.
Here is the revised tentative FOMC meeting schedule for the coming year:
March 17-18 (Tuesday-Wednesday)
April 28-29 (Tuesday-Wednesday)
June 23-24 (Tuesday-Wednesday)
August 11-12 (Tuesday-Wednesday)
September 22-23 (Tuesday-Wednesday)
November 3-4 (Tuesday-Wednesday)
December 15-16 (Tuesday-Wednesday)
January 26-27, 2010 (Tuesday-Wednesday)
