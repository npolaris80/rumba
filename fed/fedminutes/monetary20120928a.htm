Share
The Federal Reserve on Friday began the quarterly publication of transaction-level information related to discount window lending to depository institutions and open market transactions.  The data in the initial release cover transactions between July 22, 2010 and September 30, 2010.  The transaction-level detail supplements the extensive aggregate information the Federal Reserve has previously provided in weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports.
Data on discount window loans include the name of the borrowing institution, the amount borrowed, the interest rate charged, and information about collateral pledged. 
Data on open market transactions include temporary and permanent purchases and sales of Treasury and agency securities, securities lending activities, and foreign exchange transactions and foreign currency reserve investments.  Information on each transaction includes the identity of the counterparty, the security or currency purchased or sold, and the date, amount, and price of the transaction. 
In December 2010, the Federal Reserve released detailed information about individual credit and other transactions conducted during the financial crisis.  In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, transaction-level details for discount window loans and open market transactions will be made available on a quarterly basis and with an approximately two-year lag.  Information is available through the Federal Reserve Board's website and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's website .
