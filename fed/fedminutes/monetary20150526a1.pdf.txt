Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis had voted on April 16, 
2015, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Atlanta, and 
San Francisco had voted on April 23, to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and 
advances (3/4 percent) under the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The 
directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis had voted on April 16 to establish 
a rate of 1/2 percent (a decrease from 3/4 percent).  The directors of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Kansas City had voted on April 16, and the directors of the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Dallas had voted on April 23, to 
establish a rate of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on April 13, 
the Board had taken no action on requests by the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas to change the primary 
credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors noted that unusually harsh winter weather had 

contributed to an overall slowing in economic growth in recent months, although 
directors also pointed to continued strong activity in some sectors and regions.  For the 
most part, the slowdown was expected to prove transitory, with directors generally 
positive about the prospects for economic growth going forward.  Increases in broad 
measures of nominal wages remained modest, but several directors reported a 
continuing shortage of skilled workers and, in some cases, increased attention to hiring 
and retention.  Inflation continued to run below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent 
objective, reflecting in part transitory factors such as lower energy prices.  Against this 
backdrop, most directors recommended that the current primary credit rate be 
maintained. 

However, other Federal Reserve Bank directors viewed current and anticipated 

economic conditions as warranting either an increase or a decrease in the primary 
credit rate.  Some directors supported increasing the primary credit rate by 25 basis 
points (to 1 percent), while other directors favored reducing the rate by 25 basis points 
(to 1/2 percent).  The directors requesting an increase, which would widen the spread 
between the primary credit rate and the upper end of the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 75 basis points, favored a move back toward the pre-crisis spread in light 
of their outlook for economic and financial conditions as well as the risks to that outlook. 
Those directors favoring a reduction in the primary credit rate believed that a lower 
setting would be appropriate in light of the possible risks to the attainment of the Federal 
Reserve's inflation objective.
