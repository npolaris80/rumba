The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting of June 21-22, 2011, will be released at 2 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, July 12, 2011, a day earlier than usual. The release date was rescheduled in light of the timing of the House Financial Services Committee hearing on July 13 to receive the Federal Reserve Board's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.
The minutes of each regularly scheduled meeting of the FOMC are ordinarily made available three weeks after the day of the policy decision. A summary of economic projections made by the Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents for the June 21-22 meeting will be included as an addendum to the minutes.
