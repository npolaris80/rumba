Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 

the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Chicago had voted on November 19, 
2015, to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the

Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City had voted

Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and 
San Francisco Reserve Banks to increase, and by the Minneapolis Reserve Bank to

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed in favor of considering the

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Minneapolis had voted on December 3, 
2015, to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (3/4 percent) under the 
primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve 
Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis had voted on December 3, and 
the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas 
City, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on December 10, to establish a rate of 
1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its meeting on November 23, the Board 
had taken no action on requests by the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, 
Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Reserve Banks to increase, 
and by the Minneapolis Reserve Bank to decrease, the primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors generally judged that economic activity was 

advancing at a moderate pace, although reports were somewhat mixed across different 
sectors and Districts.  Growth in consumer spending was solid in most parts of the 
country, with online sales and spending on autos particularly strong.  Many directors 
noted favorable conditions in housing markets and increased construction activity, 
particularly for multifamily housing.  However, manufacturing activity remained sluggish, 
and exports continued to lag.  Most directors reported sustained improvements in labor 

Page  2 

market conditions, and the unemployment rate had declined further.  Directors pointed 
to recruiting difficulties and increasing wage pressures in certain sectors and parts of 
the country, particularly for highly skilled jobs.  Inflation, however, remained below the 
Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective, reflecting in part the temporary effects of lower 
energy prices. 

Against this backdrop, some Federal Reserve Bank directors favored maintaining 

the current primary credit rate, noting in particular that inflation remained below the 
Federal Reserve's objective and that the degree of slack in the labor market was 
uncertain at this time.  However, other Federal Reserve Bank directors recommended 
increasing the primary credit rate (to 1 percent), in light of the improvements in labor 
market conditions this year and an expectation that inflation would rise gradually toward 
the Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective.  Most directors supporting an increase 
favored a gradual adjustment to the stance of monetary policy in light of the current rate 
of inflation, which remained significantly below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent 
objective, and the actual and anticipated effects of global economic and financial 
developments on inflation and economic activity. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chair Yellen, Vice Chairman Fischer,

 and Governors Tarullo, Powell, and Brainard.

MONETARY POLICY IMPLEMENTATION -- Increase in the interest rate on reserve 
balances; increase in discount and advance rates. 

Approved. 
December 16, 2015. 

In a joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board today, 

the Committee had decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 
25 basis points, to 1/4 percent to 1/2 percent, effective December 17, 2015.  To support 
the Committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board 
approved raising the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances from 
1/4 percent to 1/2 percent, effective December 17, 2015.  The Board also acted on 
requests by ten Reserve Banks to increase the rate for discounts and advances under 
the primary credit program (primary credit rate). 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis had voted 
on December 3, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, 
Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted on December 10, 
to establish a primary credit rate of 1 percent (an increase from 3/4 percent).  At its 
meeting on December 14, the Board had considered, but had taken no action on, the 
requests to increase the primary credit rate.  At today's meeting, there was consensus 
for a 25-basis-point increase, and the Board approved an increase in the primary credit 
rate from 3/4 percent to 1 percent, effective December 17, 2015, for the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, 
St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.

It was understood that a press release and an accompanying document on 
monetary policy implementation would be issued to announce the increases in the 
interest rate on reserve balances and the primary credit rate.  In addition, the Secretary 
was authorized to inform the remaining Reserve Banks, on their establishment of a 
primary credit rate of 1 percent, of the Board's approval and determination, effective on 
the later of December 17, 2015, and the date such Reserve Banks informed the 
Secretary of such a request.  (NOTE:  Subsequently, the Secretary informed the 
Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Minneapolis of the Board's approval of their 
establishment of a primary credit rate of 1 percent, effective December 17, 2015.)
