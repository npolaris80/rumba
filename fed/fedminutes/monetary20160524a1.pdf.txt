Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas had voted on April 14, 
2016, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, 
Philadelphia, Atlanta, and St. Louis had voted on April 21, to reestablish the existing rate 
for discounts and advances (1 percent) under the primary credit program (primary credit

Federal Reserve Bank directors cited continued improvement in labor markets, 
including significant payroll gains and increases in labor force participation.  Although 
many directors noted a recent slowdown in economic growth, they were generally 
positive about the prospects for moderate increases in economic activity going forward. 
Directors provided mixed reports on consumer spending, including some easing in the 
growth of auto sales.  Several directors noted steady-to-increasing housing-sector 
activity, but others cited ongoing weakness in the agriculture and energy sectors.  Some 
directors noted the potential implications of global economic and financial developments 
for export-related activity.  Some directors reported moderate wage pressures for 
certain jobs, as well as difficulty hiring and retaining some types of skilled and unskilled 
workers.  Inflation remained below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective. 

Against this backdrop, most Federal Reserve Bank directors recommended that 

the current primary credit rate be maintained.  Other Federal Reserve Bank directors 
recommended increasing the primary credit rate to 1-1/4 percent, in light of current and 
anticipated economic conditions, improvements in the labor market, and expectations 
that inflation would rise toward the Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective over the 
medium term. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chair Yellen, Vice Chairman Fischer, and

 Governors Tarullo, Powell, and Brainard.
