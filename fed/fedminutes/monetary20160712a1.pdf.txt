2016, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, 
Philadelphia, Atlanta, and St. Louis had voted on May 19, to reestablish the existing rate

rate).  The directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas 
City, and San Francisco had voted on May 12 to establish a rate of 1-1/4 percent (an

Banks to increase the primary credit rate. 

At today's meeting, no sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit

DISCOUNT AND ADVANCE RATES -- Requests by six Reserve Banks to maintain 
the existing rate and requests by six Reserve Banks to increase the primary credit 
rate. 

Existing rate maintained. 
June 13, 2016. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis had voted on 
June 2, 2016, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Chicago, and 
Dallas had voted on June 9, to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances 
(1 percent) under the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the 
Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Richmond, and St. Louis had voted on June 2, and 
the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Kansas City, and San 
Francisco had voted on June 9, to establish a rate of 1-1/4 percent (an increase from 
1 percent).  At its meeting on May 23, the Board had taken no action on requests by the 
Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco Reserve Banks to increase the 
primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors generally indicated that economic activity was 

expanding at a moderate pace, though their reports were somewhat mixed across 
different sectors and Districts.  Several directors noted improvements in consumer 
spending and a high level of auto sales.  They also reported further progress in the 
housing sector, along with rising prices for single-family homes.  Reports on commercial 
real estate generally pointed to continued strength.  However, directors also cited 
ongoing weakness in manufacturing, agriculture, and export-related industries.  Labor 
market indicators were improving, but several directors reported that companies were

being cautious about adding staff.  Some directors also noted that businesses were still 
having difficulty hiring and retaining workers for particular occupations and in certain 
regions.  Inflation remained below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective. 

Against this backdrop, directors at several Federal Reserve Banks recommended 

that the current primary credit rate be maintained.  In general, they judged that labor 
market conditions and below-target inflation supported maintaining the current 
accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Other Federal Reserve Bank directors 
recommended increasing the primary credit rate to 1-1/4 percent, in light of actual and 
expected strengthening in economic activity and their expectations for inflation to 
gradually move toward the 2 percent objective. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chair Yellen, Vice Chairman Fischer, and

 Governors Tarullo, Powell, and Brainard.
