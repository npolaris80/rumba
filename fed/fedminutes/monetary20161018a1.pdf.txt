Existing rate maintained. 
September 19, 2016. 

Subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors, the directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Minneapolis had voted on September 8, 
2016, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago had voted on 
September 15, to reestablish the existing rate for discounts and advances (1 percent) 
under the primary credit program (primary credit rate).  The directors of the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco had voted 
on September 8, and the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, 
Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City had voted on September 15, to establish a rate of 
1-1/4 percent (an increase from 1 percent).  At its meeting on August 29, the Board had 
taken no action on requests by the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, 
St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Reserve Banks to increase the 
primary credit rate. 

Federal Reserve Bank directors generally indicated that economic activity was 
expanding at a moderate pace, though their reports varied somewhat across sectors 
and Districts.  Several directors had positive reports on consumer spending, including 
continued strength in auto sales in some Districts.  Many directors noted solid 
performance in the housing sector, as well as healthy activity in commercial 
construction.  Some directors commented on continued weakness in the global 
economy and some downside risks to the global outlook.  Most directors noted tighter 

Page  2 

U.S. labor markets across skill levels and different sectors, accompanied by upward 
pressures on compensation for many categories of workers.  Inflation remained below 
the Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective. 

Against this backdrop, some Federal Reserve Bank directors recommended that 

the primary credit rate be maintained at its current level of 1 percent.  In general, they 
judged that the economic outlook and below-target inflation supported maintaining the 
current accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Most Federal Reserve Bank 
directors recommended increasing the primary credit rate to 1-1/4 percent, in light of 
actual and expected strengthening in economic activity and labor markets, which should 
foster a gradual return of inflation to 2 percent over the medium term. 

Today, Board members considered the primary credit rate and discussed, on a 

preliminary basis, their individual assessments of the appropriate rate and its 
communication, which would be discussed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee this week.  No sentiment was expressed for changing the primary credit rate 
before the Committee's meeting, and the existing rate was maintained.  Thereafter, a 
discussion of economic and financial developments and issues related to possible 
policy actions took place. 

Participating in this determination:  Chair Yellen, Vice Chairman Fischer, and

 Governors Tarullo, Powell, and Brainard.
